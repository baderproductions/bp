        "who2": "Now you might be wondering two things:",
        "who3": "1.What kind of name is Bria ? Well, shortly after being born the nurse asked my mom what she wants to name me and what my mom actually said was Brian but the nurse misheard and that's how Bria came to be one of my names. üòÖ",
        "who4": "2.Are Kevin and Brian common names in Romania ? Not really, but I guess my parents had different plans when it came to naming me and I don't blame them. Their name choice influenced my life in a weirdly interesting way, that's all I can say about it.",
        "who5": "When it came to schooling and school subjects I was doing great only at those which I either had a personal interest in or had great teachers which always got me interested in the subject. When it came to the rest of the subjects I was good enough to pass them at the end of every semester.",
        "who6": "I followed the basic romanian education plan that ended with high-school which is equivalent to 12th grade around the world.",
        "who7": "That's how far I my parents afforded to support me in terms of education. I was curious to learn more, I couldn't afford it and the options I had in my home town were basically none when it came to what I was actually interested in which was computer science. So I had no other option than the self-taught route.",
        "first": "üë∂ Early curiosity",
        "first1": "I remember back in my preschool days my parents buying me toys like remote control cars and other mechanical toys with which I'd play with for a few hours then always disassemble them in order to find out how they work from the inside.",
        "first2": "When I was around 10 years old I was given my first computer, it was a Intel Pentium 4 and one day, out of curiosity just like I did with all my other toys I wrote numbers on every component so I'd know where to put them back then I took it apart and successfully put it back together. Ever since that day I became a computer fixer, always assembling and repairing my own computers.",
        "first3": "When I started to get interested in coding I learned by listening to other people in the industry that we have very similar childhood stories in terms of curiosity and taking things apart to see how they work.",
        "first4": ", this interview is a great example of that mindset. I couldn't have said it better myself in terms of how I all started.",
        "second": "üë£ First contact",
        "second1": "During high-school I used to play Metin2, an online MMORPG with a friend of mine. After a few good months of playing it I got bored even though most of the players (even my friend, to this day) stay addicted to that game. Instead, what I was more intrerested in was to find out how the game works on the inside, how the mechanics of the gameplay are coded, linking of the 3D models and how things get implemented in the game's C++ source.",
        "second2": "So I opened my own Metin2 private-server from open sourced files found on the internet and started messing around with the game's source code.",
        "second3": "After getting familiar with how the game works, it hit me one day that there's a player-related vulnerability that I can exploit. Because the Metin2 official servers are hard and take a long time investment to get a decent character, players tend to go for the private server which are easier.",
        "second4": "The vulnerability was the fact that I also played both official and private servers and used the same *username* and *password* for all my accounts. I was curious if I was the only one doing this. I then started to check if my theory was true and I was right, I wasn't alone.",
        "second5": "After exploiting the vulnerability for a few days by cross-checking accounts from private servers on the official servers with the *copy-paste* method I was thinking *How can I make this faster ?* and that's how I coded my first VB.Net application by copying chunks of code from ",
        "second6": " and sticking them together in order to make the computer do the checking for me.",
        "second7": "After getting familiar with Microsoft Visual Studio I decided to re-write the application in C# because at that time I liked the syntax and structure of C# more than that of VB.NET and it turned out to be a great choice.",
        "second8": " WARNING - noob code ahead ",
        "second9": "The code can be seen on GitHub @ ",
        "second10": ", even though I'm not proud of that code's quality, it's a testament of my beginnings as a developer and for my first app I was surprised it actually worked and did what I wanted, sparing me countless hours of manual work.",
        "third": "‚úà Flying to United Kingdom",
        "third1": "After high-school I started working factory jobs in Romania which lasted about two years until one day when I felt that I'm wasting my life trapped there without any life progress, doing work I had no passion for just to be able to stay alive and keep being stuck. I was slowly dying inside and had no desire to live that life anymore.",
        "third2": "I had to make a change. Having decent english understanding, speaking and writing I decided to sell my computer and guitar then bought a plane ticket and got the cheapest flight to to United Kingdom with a stopover flight in Milan, Italy. I landed in UK on 16th of October, 2018 and two weeks later I started working as a part-time Chef at ",
        "third3": "I choose a part-time job because I needed free time to be able to do what really interested me. It was a very easy-going job, meet amazing people during my time there and it was just the right balance between free time and living expenses.",
        "forth": "üåé Web development",
        "forth1": "If you read the previous chapter you know that on November, 2018 I started working as a Chef at PizzaExpress which allowed me to buy myself a powerful computer, which was a requirement for me to be able to do everything I wanted to do from gaming to video editing and the most important thing, after getting bored of all the games was coding.",
        "forth2": "As I didn't play games anymore, I didn't have any ideas of what to build in order to learn a new programming language or improve the one I started with, therefore searching for ideas I came across some life changing people and their YouTube channels, I will name three of them:",
        "forth3": "That's how I got inspired and started learning web development. Started with HTML, CSS, Javascript and jQuery as most web dev newbies do and after playing around with those for about one week I noticed a very interesting functionality that some websites had and I couldn't reproduce it with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript.",
        "fifth": "üìò React.js library",
        "fifth1": "As I said in the previous chapter, I noticed something I couldn't replicate with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript, which was when a website with more than one page would NOT refresh the browser everytime I navigate to another page like the vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript websites do.",
        "fifth2": "After doing some research on ",
        "fifth3": " I found out that the way to implement what I was looking for can be easily done with a Javascript library and the first I stumbled upon was ",
        "fifth4": " which has this object called ",
        "fifth5": " that attaches itself to the HTML *root* element and from there on you build your HTML using components inside the React application with a specific syntax called ",
        "fifth6": "After discovering Javascript libraries I realized that the possibilities for building complex structures were endless considering all the open-source packages that developers around the world create and mantain.",
