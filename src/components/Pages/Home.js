                    Ever since my younger days I was a curious individual. After
                    playing for a few days with any of the toys my parents
                    bought me, it always ended by opening them up to find out
                    what are the mechanisms that make them work the way they do.

                    At 10 years old I builded my first computer piece by piece.
                    <br />
                    And more recently I managed to 'hack(intosh)' my AMD Ryzen
                    computer into running macOS (Apple's OS), running both
                    Windows 10 and macOS High Sierra in dual-boot.

                    One that comes to mind right away is getting so absorbed in
                    my work that I lose track of time. I know I should be more
                    aware of the clock, but when I love what I'm doing I just
                    can't think of anything else.

                    <br />
                    Another one would be the fact that I'm brutally honest with
                    people around me. Some people are finding this hard to
                    swallow but this is my way of making sure that I don't waste
                    anybody's time. Going straight to the problem's core and
                    fixing it right away.

                    The story goes such that about two years ago, working a
                    factory job in Romania I realised that there's no future for
                    me there. I felt stuck in my own country with no options.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Therefore I choose to look forward to a decision I wanted to
                    make for a long time. I sold my computer and my guitar,
                    booked my plane ticket and I flew to England.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    It was the thoughest decision in my life to leave home with
                    Â£50 cash in my wallet and a plane ticket but it was worth it
                    every penny because now I can honestly say that it was the
                    best decision I ever made.

                    Don't get me wrong, my current job as a Chef is a great
                    artistic escape and I really enjoy cooking because is a
                    primal thing we all share. I've had this job for 1.5 years
                    now, it's not a full-time job and the only reason I've had
                    theis job is to pay the bills while I was learning Web
                    Development.
                    <br />
                    <br />I feel I have to move forward in my career progression
