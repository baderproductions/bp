# Introduction

I builded this website as a show-off platform to present all my Web Development projects Frontend to Backend.<br> This particular website is builded with React and is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) with a **custom domain**: https://baderproductions.net/ <br> On the backend side I used Node.JS with [Express routing](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html) and [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) all on a [Google Cloud Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=emea-gb-all-en-dr-bkws-all-all-trial-e-gcp-1008073&utm_content=text-ad-none-any-DEV_c-CRE_253506732952-ADGP_Hybrid+%7C+AW+SEM+%7C+BKWS+~+EXA_M:1_GB_EN_Compute_Compute+Engine_google+cloud+computing+engine-KWID_43700053285287153-kwd-77536802412-userloc_9045906&utm_term=KW_google%20cloud%20computing%20engine-NET_g-PLAC_&gclid=Cj0KCQjwrIf3BRD1ARIsAMuugNsIMJRuIGffFxG_8r5aH8JzgV4BAPXrLU2rix0el62j9GDc3x63GokaAi8DEALw_wcB).
